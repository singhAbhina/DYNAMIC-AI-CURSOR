# DYNAMIC-AI-CURSOR
IT IS A AGANTIC MODEL THAT CAN GENERATE WEBSITE




A powerful web application that leverages **Googleâ€™s Gemini AI** to dynamically generate complete websites based on user descriptions. Users can input text prompts, and the system will produce a fully functional HTML file, styled with CSS, and interactive with JavaScript. The frontend allows users to preview the site, review the code, and download the project as a ZIP file for deployment.

This project is ideal for developers, designers, and hobbyists looking to quickly prototype websites using artificial intelligence.
